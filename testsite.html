<h1>Homepage</h1>
<p>
<br>
This site was made by me for a project for a class. It consists of 8 pages including this one. The first of these pages is the homepage. This page is a general informational page with some navigation help. This is also the page you are currently on right now. This was the first page that I made for this website. The next page is the favorite things page. On that page there is information about what I like to do in my free time. It is significantly longer than this page. The page after that is the music page, which, as the name suggests, is about music that I like. The next page is some thoughts tha I had about this website and html in general. The About page consists of general information. This is the avatar of me.
